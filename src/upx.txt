UPX is use when compiling Infero.dll in "Distro" mode to compress the DLL.

1. Download here:
https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/latest (win64 version)

2. Place UPX.exe in the [distro/src] folder or make it accessable from
   a global path.

   post-build event to compress the Infero.dll to smallest possible size.
